# Citizen science  and discovery in online environments

## Work plan

1. Data checkout for projects (Shakespeare's World, Serengeti, Planet Hunters?)
2. Project managers pick out a couple of threads where they have identified some
sort of discovery process.
3. Iterative computational analysis where the relevant threads/content is
identified in the datasets. Here also some quantitative analysis is required.
4. Qualitative analysis of selected forum data.
5. Write together manuscript.
6. Submit.

## Introduction
Discovery is essential to scientific progress. It is also one of the reasons
that the sciences and humanities attract large interest from the general
public and one of the reasons for why science is the preferred method of
obtaining new and useful knowledge in society.

By convention, scientific discoveries have been closely associated with
educated or professional scientists breaking new grounds by tediously, and with
the aid of expert knowledges, working his or her way towards unveiling the
unknown territories that have escaped human knowledge up until now.

However, as citizen science projects have begun inviting non-scientist into
the immediate work with source data and observations, discovery of new
phenomena have been extended to a much larger crowd of people, many of them
lacking formal training or education, but often being devoted to the subject
matter of what is being studied.

## Purpose and research questions
The purpose of this article is to understand how discoveries are made by
non-scientists in online forum environments. From the perspective of how
volunteer contributors discuss and analyse scientific data, the following
questions can be posed:

1. How are phenomena and data identified as novel discoveries?
2. What additional/contextual knowledge is required to define a discovery?
3. How are new discoveries understood in terms of attribution and recognition?
